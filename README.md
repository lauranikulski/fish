# fish

Presented for Codecademy meet-up 

https://community.codecademy.com/events/details/codecademy-seoul-presents-visualising-data-with-seaborn-jupyter-notebooks-community-showcase-60-minutes/

In this meet-up, we will start out by analysing a real-life dataset adapted from data provided by the UK government on Jupyter. Python Pandas and Seaborn will help load and visualise the data and allow us to ask and perhaps attempt to answer questions about the data provided. As we go along, I will also talk about the bugs and issues I encountered along the way and how I solved them - alternative solutions are welcome from your end as you may have better ideas!  


In keeping with the Seaborn/nautical/marine theme, the dataset is about sea fishing. Source data here: Monthly Sea Fisheries Statistics August 2021.  

Following a presentation and live demo, we will go straight into a community showcase. If you are currently working on a project that is data science, data visualisation or data analysis related, or if you have completed a project in the past, do share your work and your insights! All levels are welcome. 😊
